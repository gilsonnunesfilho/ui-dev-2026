# Challenge UI Developer 2026

## Design Proposal

Create a design proposal that reflects the wireframe

The Internal Systems Team requested a page for you. They have sent over a wireframe, all content of the page:

**Your task** is to propose a design (don't use component library, such as Bootstrap or Material) that reflects the given wireframe.

Your solution should:

- **Use** the System Font, like Roboto, SF Pro, Segoe UI and others;
- Must provide validation examples;
- Be **responsive**;
- Be **accessible**;
- **Use** a component library;
- Save the file as **PNG**;

Keep in mind that there may be other internal services created by other
developers that must follow the same visual identity.

## Assets

The challenge prides us with a wireframe image and some brand colors

### Wireframe

![Candidate Registration wireframe showing the page layout with top navigation, form fields, and footer](/wireframe.avif)

An image of a wireframe. It shows a "Candidate Registration" Page, Composed by three parts:

- Top Bar
- Main
- Footer

#### Top Bar

A top bar main navigation with the brand on the left, followed-by, also to the left, by three links:

- Home
- Register (selected)
- About

Still in the top bar, but to the right side:

- An Icon Button with a Bell Icon and a badge with the number 2. Likely a notification area.
- A Button with a Person Icon, the first name of the person and a chevron down icon. Probably an "account" dropdown menu.

#### Main

The main page has a simple Title and, bellow it, a two-column form with the following inputs:

- First name (text)
- Last name (text)
- Email (text)
- Phone (text)
- Address (optional text)
- CV File (file)
  - With supporting text saying: "Allowed files: .pdf, .doc and .odt."

It also contains two actions:

- Send
- Clear

#### Footer

The footer is the simplest possible. With just a copyright centered text and nothing else.

- "&copy; 2022 ACME. All rights reserved.
